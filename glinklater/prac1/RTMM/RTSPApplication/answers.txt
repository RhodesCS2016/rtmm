1. The RTSP process would have to be altered at the level of the RTP packets themselves. Both the client and the server would need to parse and react differently to different payload types as defined by the various profile for RTP/AVP. Separate implementations would have to follow for each different AVP that one would like to be able to consume and serve on the client and server respectively.

2. The RTSP protocol specifies that the parameters of the session can be changed on any frame boundary and this must be supported in the media encoding. The server will the adjust according to the new parameters specified. This can be done by setting the extension bit in the fixed header and appending the extension header with the changes that one would like to make to the stream. The client needs to be able to assemble and send the extension header and the server needs to be able to parse and adjust accordingly; the RTPpacket needs to account for the fact that there could be additional data following the fixed header if the extension bit is set.
